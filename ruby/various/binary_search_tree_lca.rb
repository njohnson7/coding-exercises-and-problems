# binary_search_tree_lca.rb

# Using the Ruby language, have the function BinarySearchTreeLCA(strArr) take
# the array of strings stored in strArr, which will contain 3 elements: the
# first element will be a binary search tree with all unique values in a
# preorder traversal array, the second and third elements will be two different
# values, and your goal is to find the lowest common ancestor of these two
# values. For example: if strArr is ["[10, 5, 1, 7, 40, 50]", "1", "7"] then
# this tree looks like the following:

#      10
#     /  \
#    5    40
#   / \    \
#  1   7    50

# For the input above, your program should return 5 because that is the value of
# the node that is the LCA of the two nodes with values 1 and 7. You can assume
# the two nodes you are searching for in the tree will exist somewhere in the
# tree.
